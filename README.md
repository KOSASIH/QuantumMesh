# Description 

QuantumMesh is a next-generation Git repository for Pi Network, leveraging quantum computing principles to develop ultra-secure cryptographic protocols, quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum-enhanced consensus mechanisms. By using quantum computing, QuantumMesh ensures the network's resilience against future threats and provides a secure and decentralized platform for developers to build on.

# Features

1. Quantum-enhanced cryptographic protocols for secure communication
2. Quantum-resistant algorithms for secure data storage and processing
3. Quantum-enhanced consensus mechanisms for secure and decentralized decision-making
4. Integration with Git for version control and collaboration
5. Support for quantum computing simulators and hardware
6. Open-source and community-driven development

# Installation

To install QuantumMesh, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash

1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumMesh.git
2. cd QuantumMesh
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

To use QuantumMesh, you can create a new repository and initialize it with the QuantumMesh configuration:

```bash

1. quantummesh init
```

This will create a new .qmesh directory with the necessary configuration files.
You can then add and commit files as you would with a regular Git repository:

```bash

1. quantummesh add .
2. quantummesh commit -m "Initial commit"
```

To push your changes to the QuantumMesh network, you can use the quantummesh push command:

```bash

1. quantummesh push
```
This will encrypt your changes using quantum-enhanced cryptographic protocols and upload them to the QuantumMesh network.
